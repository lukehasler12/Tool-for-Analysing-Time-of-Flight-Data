# Tool-for-Analysing-Time-of-Flight-Data
A tool using regression techniques and a knee finder algorithm to investigate time-of-flight datasets.

I will soon write a short instruction manual on how to effectively use the algorithm as I know certain steps can be a little bit tricky without prior training. That will come after I have completed my project report.
